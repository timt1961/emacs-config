;;; Commentary:

;; Quickstart Installation:
;; ========================
;;
;; To get this to work, make emacs execute the line
;;
;; (require 'todo-mode)				;; load the TODO package
;;
;; You may now enter new items by typing "M-x todo-insert-item", or enter
;; your the TODO list file by typing "M-x todo-show".
;;
;; The TODO list file has a special format and some auxiliary information,
;; which will be added by the todo-show function if it attempts to visit
;; an un-initialised file.  Hence it is recommended to use the todo-show
;; function for the first time, in order to initialise the file, but it
;; is not necessary afterwards.
;;
;; As these commands are quite long to type, I would recommend the addition
;; of two bindings to your to your global keymap.  I personally have the
;; following in my initialisation file:
;;
;; (global-set-key "\C-ct" 'todo-show)		;; switch to TODO buffer
;; (global-set-key "\C-ci" 'todo-insert-item)	;; insert new item
;;
;; Note, however, that this recommendation has prompted some criticism,
;; since the keys C-c LETTER are reserved for user functions.  I believe
;; my recommendation is acceptable, since the Emacs Lisp Manual *Tips*
;; section also details that the mode itself should not bind any functions
;; to those keys.  The express aim of the above two bindings is to work
;; outside the mode, which doesn't need the show function and offers
;; a different binding for the insert function.  They serve as shortcuts
;; and are not even needed (since the TODO mode will be entered by
;; visiting the TODO file, and later by switching to its buffer).
;;
;;
;;
;; Pre-Requisites
;; ==============
;;
;; This package will require the following packages to be available on
;; the load-path:
;;                 - time-stamp
;;                 - easymenu
;;
;;
;;
;; Description:
;; ============
;;
;; TODO is a major mode for EMACS which offers functionality to treat
;; most lines in one buffer as a list of items one has to do.  There
;; are facilities to add new items, which are categorised, to edit or
;; even delete items from the buffer.  The buffer contents are currently
;; compatible with the diary, so that the list of todo-items will show
;; up in the FANCY diary mode.
;;
;; Notice:  Besides the major mode, this file also exports the function
;; "todo-show" which will change to the one specific TODO file that has
;; been specified in the todo-file-do variable.  If this file does not
;; conform to the TODO mode conventions, the todo-show function will add
;; the appropriate header and footer.  I don't anticipate this to cause
;; much grief, but be warned, in case you attempt to read a plain text file.
;;
;;
;;
;; Operation:
;; ==========
;;
;; You will have the following facilities available:
;;
;; M-x todo-show              will enter the todo list screen, here type
;;
;; +                          to go to next category
;; -                          to go to previous category
;; e                          to edit the current entry
;; f                          to file the current entry, including a
;;                                                 comment and timestamp
;; i                          to insert a new entry
;; k                          to kill the current entry
;; l                          to lower the current entry's priority
;; n                          for the next entry
;; p                          for the previous entry
;; q                          to save the list and exit the buffer
;; r                          to raise the current entry's priority
;; s                          to save the list
;;
;; When you add a new entry, you are asked for the text and then for the
;; category.  I for example have categories for things that I want to do
;; in the office (like mail my mum), that I want to do in town (like buy
;; cornflakes) and things I want to do at home (move my suitcases).  The
;; categories can be selected with the cursor keys and if you type in the
;; name of a category which didn't exist before, an empty category of the
;; desired name will be added and filled with the new entry.
;;
;;
;;
;; Configuration:
;; ==============
;;
;; --- todo-prefix
;;
;; I would like to recommend that you use the prefix "*/*" (by
;; leaving the variable 'todo-prefix' untouched) so that the diary
;; displays each entry every day.
;;
;; To understand what I mean, please read the documentation that goes
;; with the calendar since that will tell you how you can set up the
;; fancy diary display and use the #include command to include your
;; todo list file as part of your diary.
;;
;; If you have the diary package set up to usually display more than
;; one day's entries at once, consider using
;;   "&%%(equal (calendar-current-date) date)"
;; as the value of `todo-prefix'.  Please note that this may slow down
;; the processing of your diary file some.
;;
;;
;; --- todo-file-do
;;
;; This variable is fairly self-explanatory.  You have to store your TODO
;; list somewhere.  This variable tells the package where to go and find
;; this file.
;;
;;
;; --- todo-file-done
;;
;; Even when you're done, you may wish to retain the entries.  Given
;; that they're timestamped and you are offered to add a comment, this
;; can make a useful diary of past events.  It will even blend in with
;; the EMACS diary package.  So anyway, this variable holds the name
;; of the file for the filed todo-items.
;;
;;
;; --- todo-mode-hook
;;
;; Just like other modes, too, this mode offers to call your functions
;; before it goes about its business.  This variable will be inspected
;; for any functions you may wish to have called once the other TODO
;; mode preparations have been completed.
;;
;;
;; --- todo-insert-threshold
;;
;; Another nifty feature is the insertion accuracy.  If you have 8 items
;; in your TODO list, then you may get asked 4 questions by the binary
;; insertion algorithm.  However, you may not really have a need for such
;; accurate priorities amongst your TODO items.  If you now think about
;; the binary insertion halfing the size of the window each time, then
;; the threshhold is the window size at which it will stop.  If you set
;; the threshhold to zero, the upper and lower bound will coincide at the
;; end of the loop and you will insert your item just before that point.
;; If you set the threshhold to i.e. 8, it will stop as soon as the window
;; size drops below that amount and will insert the item in the approximate
;; centre of that window.  I got the idea for this feature after reading
;; a very helpful e-mail reply from Trey Jackson <trey@cs.berkeley.edu>
;; who corrected some of my awful coding and pointed me towards some good
;; reading.  Thanks Trey!
;;
;;
;;
;;
;; Things to do:
;; =============
;;
;; - licence / version function
;; - export to diary file
;; - todo-report-bug
;; - GNATS support
;; - add idea from Urban Boquist <boquist@cs.chalmers.se>: multi-line-entries
;; - 'e' opens buffer for multi-line entry
;; - elide multiline
;; - rewrite complete package to store data as lisp objects and have
;;   display modes for display, for diary export, etc.
;;
;;
;;
;; History and Gossip:
;; ===================
;;
;; Many thanks to all the ones who have contributed to the evolution of this
;; package!  I hope I have listed all of you somewhere in the documentation
;; or at least in the RCS history!
;;
;; Enjoy this package and express your gratitude by sending nice things
;; to my parents' address!

;;; Change Log:

;; $Log: todo-mode.el,v $
;; Revision 1.18  1997/10/15  17:18:11  os10000
;; Everything seems to work in Harald Melands Emacs 20.02 and
;; my Emacs 19.34.  Beware of the spelling in some of the
;; variable names.  I looked up "threshold" in a dictionary
;; and here in Britain this appears to be the way to spell it.
;;
;; Revision 1.17  1997/10/15  14:30:41  os10000
;; Attempted to reconcile Harald's changes with mine since 1.15.
;;
;; Revision 1.16  1997/10/15  14:00:12  os10000
;; Fixed 'file-item' and added 20.02 split-string function.
;;
;; Revision 1.15  1997/10/14  22:22:35  os10000
;; Added string-split (which I stole from ediff-util), changed
;; pop-to-buffer to switch-to-buffer and added message on how
;; to exit the multi-line-edit mode.
;;
;; Revision 1.14  1997/10/09  09:24:50  os10000
;; Harald Meland <harald.meland@usit.uio.no> asked for
;; the latest version, got 1.13, and returned this.
;; He writes:
;;
;; Thanks a lot for the new version of todo-mode.el.  As you will see I
;; have messed it up a bit, hopefully for the better -- I don't like
;; short, cryptic names for variables and functions, so I renamed most of
;; them, and `defalias'ed the old function names.  I hope you don't mind
;; too much, I just kinda couldn't stop myself.
;;
;; Additionally, I included some support for multiline entries, cleaned
;; up (IMHO :) a lot of the code, included completion-support for which
;; category to install a new entry in, and possibly some other changes I
;; can't remember :)
;;
;; It's getting rather late, and I have just done some preliminary
;; testing on whether all of this really works, but so far it looks
;; good.
;;
;; Revision 1.13  1997/08/19  14:00:36  seidel
;; - changed name to todo-mode
;; - fixed menu descriptions
;; - fixed "pressing abort while filing"
;; - attempted Emacs Lisp Manual *Tips* section compliance
;;
;; Revision 1.12  1997/08/06  10:56:15  os10000
;; Fixed header, typos, layout, documentation.
;;
;; Revision 1.11  1997/08/06  09:14:25  os10000
;; Applied patch from Istvan Marko <istvan@cmdmail.amd.com>
;; to make menus work anywhere.
;;
;; Revision 1.10  1997/08/06  08:56:03  os10000
;; Acted upon suggestion from Shane Holder <holder@rsn.hp.com>:
;; Cancelling the editing of an entry will not delete it any more.
;;
;; Revision 1.9  1997/08/06 08:12:03  os10000
;; Improved documentation.  Broke some lines to comply with
;; Richard Stallman's email to please keep in sync with the
;; rest of the Emacs distribution files.
;;
;; Revision 1.8  1997/08/05 22:39:04  os10000
;; Made todo-mode.el available under GPL.
;;
;; Revision 1.7  1997/08/05 22:34:14  os10000
;; Fixed insertion routine with help from Trey Jackson
;; <trey@cs.berkeley.edu>; added todo-inst-tresh;
;; fixed keyboard layout to remove unwanted keys.

;;
;; Revision 1.2  1997/08/03 12:15:28  os10000
;; It appears to work.
;;
;; Revision 1.1  1997/08/03 12:15:13  os10000

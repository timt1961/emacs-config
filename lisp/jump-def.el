;;; Keywords: tags
;;;
;;; Jump to a "def" (essentially, a function or variable definition)
;;; in the current buffer.  Buffer should be visiting a file with Lisp
;;; or C code inside it, and be in the right mode for that file
;;; (although it will assume Emacs-Lisp mode if no other options).
;;; Completion is available on "def" names.
;;;
;;; INSTALLATION: 
;;;
;;; put something like this in your .emacs file:
;;;
;;; (autoload 'jump-to-def "jump-def" "Jump to a definition." t)
;;; (global-set-key "\C-cj" 'jump-to-def) ;or whatever key you want...
;;;
;;; Then just make sure that the file jump-def.el is installed
;;; somewhere in your load-path.  Byte-compile it for greater
;;; efficiency.
;;;
;;; This is intended as a replacement for tags when you know you are
;;; staying inside one file.  Its advantage is that it does not
;;; require a prebuilt tag table; its disadvantage is that in C mode
;;; it can be quite slow in building the completion list sometimes.
;;; In Lisp-like languages its performance seems to be as fast as
;;; tags, even in huge files.
;;;
;;; Modified 1995-03-08 by Noah Friedman <friedman@prep.ai.mit.edu> to add
;;; mode-sensitive jump-def-regexps and better C parsing, including emacs
;;; DEFUNs.

  "Jump to a DEF at location LOC in the current buffer.
Interactively, you will be prompted completingly for DEF, and LOC will
be computed from that.

A \"def\" is a defun, defconst, or defvar in elisp, or a function
definition in C, assuming that the variable jump-def-regexp is set to
something reasonable.  Completion is available on def names; type TAB
at the prompt to see what\'s in store for you.  If you are within the
scope of a function call, it should default to that function name.

This is intended as a replacement for tags when you know you are
staying inside one file.  Its advantage is that it does not
require a prebuilt tag table; its disadvantage is that in C mode
it can be quite slow in building the completion list sometimes.
In Emacs Lisp its performance seems to be as fast as tags, even in
huge files."

;;; Commentary:

;; The object of this classical game is to locate the hidden mines.
;; To do this, you hit the squares on the game board that do not
;; contain mines, and you mark the squares that do contain mines.

;; The number of hidden mines remaining in the mine field is indicated
;; inside the buffer.  Every time you mark a square as a mine, this
;; number decreases by one, even if you incorrectly mark a square.

;; To hit a square: Point to the square, and click the left button.
;; If the square is a mine, you loose.
;; If the square isn't a mine, a number appears, which represents
;; the number of mines in the surrounding eight squares.

;; To mark a square as a mine: Point to the square, and click
;; the right button.

;; To play Mine, compile it if you want, load it, and type `M-x mine'.

;; To get help and doc, see the functions `mine' and `mine-help'
;; (ie. type `?' in the *Mine* buffer or type `C-h f mine')

;; This module has been developed and tested with GNU Emacs 19.31.1,
;; but it should run with any GNU Emacs 19.* (at least with versions
;; superior to 19.31). 

;; This module has not been tested (yet) with XEmacs.  It may or may
;; not run (can anybody tell me?).  

;; Send any comment or bug report (do you expect to find any? ;-) to me:
;; duthen@cegelec-red.fr (Jacques Duthen)

;; Good luck.

;; 1.17 Thanks to Vladimir Alexiev <vladimir@cs.ualberta.ca>.
;; Fix bug: (void-function unless), add minimal support for xemacs.
;; (mine-xemacs-p): Added.
;; (event-point): New function.
;; (mine-mouse-hit, mine-mouse-mark): Use (interactive "@e") and `event-point'
;; (mine-init-mode-map): Support xemacs mouse binding.  
;; (mine-make-face): Support xemacs get-face.  
;; (mine-goto): Support `auto-show-make-point-visible' as well as
;; `hscroll-point-visible'.

(defun mine (num)
  "Play Mine.  Optional prefix argument is the number of mines.

To play Mine, type `\\[mine]' or `\\[universal-argument] NUM \\[mine]'.  

An optional prefix argument specifies the number of mines to be hidden
in the field.  If no prefix argument is given, a percentage
`mine-mines-%' of the field will contain mines.

What is Mine?\\<mine-mode-map>

Mine is a classical game of hide and seek played on a rectangular grid
containing `mine-xmax' by `mine-ymax' squares (the mine field).

Your opponent (Emacs, in this case) has hidden several mines within
this field.  The object of the game is to find every hidden mine.

When you're sure a square does NOT contain a mine, you can hit it:
move the mouse over the square and press `\\[mine-mouse-hit]' or 
move the cursor with the usual keys and press `\\[mine-hit-curpoint]'.

If the square is a mine, you loose.
If the square isn't a mine, a number appears which represents
the number of mines in the surrounding eight squares.  

When you think a square DOES contain a mine, you can mark it:
move the mouse over the square and press `\\[mine-mouse-mark]' or
move the cursor with the usual keys and press `\\[mine-mark-curpoint]'.

The number of hidden mines remaining in the mine field is indicated
inside the buffer.  Every time you mark a square as a mine, this
number decreases by one, even if you incorrectly mark a square.

If `mine-torus' is non-nil (the default), the Mine game is played over
a periodic field (like a torus).  Each mine is hidden periodically
over the mine board `mine-nb-tiles-x' times in the x direction and
`mine-nb-tiles-y' times in the y direction.

If `mine-colorp' is non-nil (the default, if the system allows it),
the game is displayed with colors.  The colors can be chosen with the
variable `mine-colors'.

If the redisplay is not fast enough, increase `mine-level'.  If you
want to see a smoother (slower) redisplay, decrease `mine-level',
`mine-count1-max' and `mine-count2-max'.

You can get help on `mine-mode' and its key bindings by pressing `\\[mine-help]'
while in the *Mine* buffer.

;;; Click events - nop hit mark

;;; [jack] The elisp manual says:
;;; If you want to take action as soon as a button is pressed,
;;; you need to handle "button-down" events.
;;; The global map (cf. `mouse.el') has, by default, the binding:
;;;	(define-key global-map [down-mouse-1] 'mouse-drag-region)
;;; It seems that this function "eats" the final event [mouse-1].
;;; So, we need a local binding for [down-mouse-1] which shadows
;;; the global one and prevents `mouse-drag-region' from being called.
;;; Hence, in `mine-init-mode-map' I use the following binding:
;;;	(define-key mine-mode-map [down-mouse-1] 'mine-mouse-nop)
;;; I found a better binding in "apropos.el"
;;;	(define-key mine-mode-map [down-mouse-1] nil)
;;; but, as it does not work, let's go back to nop...

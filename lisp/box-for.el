;;; Commentary:

;; This puts a box around text: I would do a whole CAD application in Emacs
;; but I just dont have the time right now :-)

;;; Usage:
;;  Place this file in your load-path
;;   Type C-h v load-path if you dont know that.
;;  Add: (require 'box-for) to your .emacs
;;  Type: M-x box-for whenever you must attach files
;;  That's it.

;;; Intent: to draw things in a line like this.

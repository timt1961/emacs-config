  These are the stylesheets I initially used to transform some DocBook
  documentation HTML files into elisp lists. After I generated them
  initially, I ended up doing some search-and-replaces within Emacs to
  make the generated lists match what I needed for docbook-menu. So, I
  still need to update these stylesheets to get them to generate the
  same thing without any additional post-processing steps.
